          <em>The Godfather</em> follows Vito Corleone's Mafia family, focusing
          on his son Michael's reluctant rise to power, dealing with loyalty,
          betrayal and crime.

          The Godfather, unlike other movies, is more realistic, with many
          intricacies based on the true nature of the world. It also focuses on
          how small things can give greater meanings and cause powerful effects,
          which is what I like the most.

          <em>My Experiments with Truth</em> is Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography,
          detailing his spiritual journey, philosophy of non-violence, struggles
          for independence, and personal reflections on morality,
          self-discipline, and truth.

          I like it, firstly because it is interesting to read about the life of
          the "Father of Our Nation." Also, it has various techniques and
          incidents which are heartwarming and amazing, showing how a simple
          common man defeated the Great British.

          Suits is a legal drama following talented college dropout Mike Ross,
          who starts working as a law associate at a prestigious firm, despite
          lacking a law degree. He teams up with top lawyer Harvey Specter,
          navigating complex cases while maintaining the secret of Mike's
          credentials. The show explores themes of loyalty, ambition, and
          personal growth in the fast-paced legal world.

        <dt><strong>Why I Like It:</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          I like <em>Suits</em> because of the real-world instances where a
          person who came from nothing is able to outsmart and outplay people
          who are seemingly at the top, all while staying humble and loyal to
          the person who allowed him to reach such heights.
