        <span>Hello, I'm</span> <strong>Pushkal Gupta</strong>,
        <span
          >and I’m originally from Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India. Currently, I’m
          pursuing a degree in</span
        >
        <b>Computer Science Engineering</b>
        <span>with a specialization in</span>
        <i>Internet of Things (IoT)</i>
        <span>
          at VIT Vellore. Technology has always intrigued me, and I feel lucky
          to be on this journey where I get to learn and grow every day in the
          world of computing. There’s so much more to explore, and I’m excited
          to keep discovering.

        <span>In high school, I studied</span>
        <b>Physics</b>, <b>Chemistry</b>, <b>Mathematics</b>, and
        <strong>Computer Science</strong>,
        <span
          >which laid a solid foundation for my interests. Over the years, I’ve
          developed a strong curiosity for</span
        >
        <strong>neural networks</strong> <span>and</span>
        <strong>machine learning algorithms</strong>,
        <span>
          and I’m eager to see how they can bring positive change to industries.
          Still, I remind myself that there’s always more to learn, and I strive
          to stay grounded and humble as I continue my exploration in these
          fields.

          Beyond academics, I try to keep a balance in life by pursuing
          activities that help me stay grounded. I enjoy playing
        </span>
        <b>basketball</b> <span>and solving</span> <b>math problems</b>,
        <span>
          which not only keep me active but also help me stay focused. I also
          love listening to songs, as they provide a sense of peace and
          inspiration. I believe that personal growth comes from a balance
          between hard work and enjoying the simple things in life.
