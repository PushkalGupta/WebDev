        Hello, I'm <strong>Pushkal Gupta</strong>, and I’m originally from Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India. Currently, I’m pursuing a degree in <b>Computer Science Engineering</b> with a specialization in <i>Internet of Things (IoT)</i> at VIT Vellore. Technology has always intrigued me, and I feel lucky to be on this journey where I get to learn and grow every day in the world of computing. There’s so much more to explore, and I’m excited to keep discovering.</p>
        <p class="p4">In high school, I studied <b>Physics</b>, <b>Chemistry</b>, <b>Mathematics</b>, and <strong>Computer Science</strong>, which laid a solid foundation for my interests. Over the years, I’ve developed a strong curiosity for <strong>neural networks</strong> and <strong>machine learning algorithms</strong>, and I’m eager to see how they can bring positive change to industries. Still, I remind myself that there’s always more to learn, and I strive to stay grounded and humble as I continue my exploration in these fields.</p>
        <p class="p5">Beyond academics, I try to keep a balance in life by pursuing activities that help me stay grounded. I enjoy playing <b>basketball</b> and solving <b>math problems</b>, which not only keep me active but also help me stay focused. I also love listening to songs, as they provide a sense of peace and inspiration. I believe that personal growth comes from a balance between hard work and enjoying the simple things in life.</p>
